> A repository to collaborate on tweets using [twitter-together](https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together).

## How to contribute a tweet

Follow [these instructions](./tweets) for a detailed guide, but the short version is: create a `.tweet` file in `/tweets` and open a pull request. We'll review it, and once it's merged, the [@nodenock](https://twitter.com/ProbotTheRobot) Twitter account will tweet it out!

## What to Tweet

All PRs merged here will be automatically tweeted on [@nodenock](http://twitter.com/nodenock). Anyone is encouraged to craft and form a tweet, by opening a PR in the tweets folder. Possible topics include:

- Interesting usage of nock
- Everything about http mocking, beyond just nock
- Interesting use cases of nock
- Items relevant to the nock community
- Code related comments in regards to nock (refactors, TODOs, and so on)

One accept is enough for a merge.
